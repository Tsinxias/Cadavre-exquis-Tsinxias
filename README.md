## The little red haired girl

**Once upon a time** in a small village, lived a little red haired girl.
Her father and mother lived with her in a house in the forest near the
village. They all had a happy life until something happened to them...

One day she was in the forest gathering mushrooms.
She stumbled upon a strange amulet, but didn't pay too much attention to it and just took it.
She finished her little walk and went home.

When she arrived home, she felt the amulet burning in her pocket. 
She placed the amulet on the table and it started glowing.
But the little red haired girl was tired and decided to take a nap.
