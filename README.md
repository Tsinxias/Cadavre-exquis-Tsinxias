## The little red haired girl

**Once upon a time** in a small village, lived a little red haired girl.
Her father and mother lived with her in a house in the forest near the
village. They all had a happy life until something happened to them...

One day she was in the forest gathering mushrooms.
She stumbled upon a strange amulet, but didn't pay too much attention to it and just took it.
She finished her little walk and went home.
