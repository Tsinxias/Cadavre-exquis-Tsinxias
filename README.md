## The little red haired girl

**Once upon a time** in a small village, lived a little red haired girl.
Her father and mother lived with her in a house in the forest near the
village. They all had a happy life until something happened to them...


One day, the little girl was walking back from picking up berries in the woods.
As she made her way back home, she started hearing some strange noises through the bushes.
At first, she didn't think much of it, forests are living organisms and she had grown up in one of them.

One day she was in the forest gathering mushrooms.
She stumbled upon a strange amulet, but didn't pay too much attention to it and just took it.
She finished her little walk and went home.

When she arrived home, she felt the amulet burning in her pocket.
She placed the amulet on the table and it started glowing.
But the little red haired girl was tired and decided to take a nap.

After waking up of what felt like a life long nap,
she got up, sat in a chair and put the amulet in her lap.
She felt a burning sensation inside , and started to rap:

### Ik ging slapen met een doezoe, werd wakker met een ton
### En vaak denk ik aan vroeger, ik weet waar het begon
### Nu denk ik aan miljoenen, nee vraag me niet waarom

## **All you need is love, love, love
## Love is all you need**
