## The little red haired girl

**Once upon a time** in a small village, lived a little red haired girl. 
Her father and mother lived with her in a house in the forest near the 
village. They all had a happy life until something happened to them...

One day, the little girl was walking back from picking up berries in the woods.
As she made her way back home, she started hearing some strange noises through the bushes.
At first, she didn't think much of it, forests are living organisms and she had grown up in one of them.
